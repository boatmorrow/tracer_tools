tracer_tools is a suite of python functionality written for modeling and interpretation of environmental tracers in groundwater.  
These tools are offered as is with little documentation and no gauruntees.  I have documented the code to some extent and have provided some examples of usage.
To install, download the tracer_tools repository.  Add the location of the repository to your PYTHONPATH variable. Good luck.    

To run the tools you will need the following python modules:
numpy
iapws
pandas
scipy
lmfit
xlrd
Tkinter
cPickle
